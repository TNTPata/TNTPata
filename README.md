- 👋 Hi, I’m @TNTPata
- 👀 I’m interested in train...stuff. Not train simulators, but rather tools and applications for education/training and making timetables. I prefer to code in C#, but basic (and i mean _basic_) web development can also be fun. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Meteor and deepening my C#-skills.
- 💞️ If you share an interest in train related stuff, and especially signalling, I'd love to contribute in some way. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I go by TNTPata or TNT_Pata on most platforms. If you can't find me, I probably don't have an account there.
